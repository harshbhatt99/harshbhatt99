### Hi, I am Harsh ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Machine Learning engineer and Roboticist. With Master degree in Mechatronics and 2 post-graduate degrees in Industrial Automation and Applied AI, I have expanded my knowledge to multiple disciplines. I enjoy working where multiple engineering and science fields are merging. I have led teams and managed projects in the past. 
Currently, I am seeking an internship / co-op in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Data Science, and Computer Vision.
I believe in sustainable innovation and intend to work in that direction.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ROS2, Machine Learning, AI projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Autonomous Navigation
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for an Internship / Co-Op in AI, Robotics, Data Science
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Sustainable Innovation & Responsible AI
